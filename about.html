  <h2>
    The Isaac David Porogi Foundation was created to honor Isaac’s legacy
    and to support children and families affected by pediatric cancer.
  </h2>
  <p>Nikki Porogi is the Director and founder of the Isaac David Porogi Foundation, Inc. Jeanine Porogi is the Secretary. Kaysi Fink, Collin Packer, and Royce Porogi are board members. We wanted to start this foundation in Honor and Memory of Isaac David Porogi. Isaac was a terrific student, an outstanding athlete, the best big brother, a great son, and an all around awesome individual. He was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, bone cancer, in December 2015 at the age of 16. He went through many rounds of chemo and had to have several surgeries. Some of these surgeries included a complete knee and femur replacement along with a complete sternotomy. Despite all of these challenges, Isaac refused to give up. He was the first osteosarcoma patient at Peyton Manning Children's Hospital to complete his physical therapy before he completed all of his rounds of chemo. Isaac fought long and hard. He battled for almost 5 years before his journey ended on July 7, 2020 at the age of 21. We made a promise to Isaac to keep his memory alive, to spread his story far and wide to inspire others to never give up, to help other families who are going through what we had to endure, and to help do every thing we can to hopefully one day find a cure. That is just what we intend to do by creating this foundation.</p>
