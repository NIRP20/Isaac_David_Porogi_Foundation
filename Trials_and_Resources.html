    <p>
      At the <strong>Isaac David Porogi Foundation</strong>, we strive to provide families and patients with reliable information on pediatric cancer research and support resources. Staying informed about available clinical trials and resources can make a real difference in care and treatment options.
    </p>

    <p>
      One excellent resource for families is the <a href="https://www.nwicancerkids.org/" target="_blank">Northwest Indiana Cancer Kids Foundation</a>. They provide guidance, support, and information about ongoing pediatric cancer trials and programs for children and families facing cancer.

      Check back often as we continue to update this page with more trials, scholarships, and resources to support children affected by pediatric cancer.
